Air Passenger Traffic Forecasting Problem: An airline company has the data on the number of passengers that have travelled with them on a particular route for the past few years. Using this data, they want to see if they can forecast the number of passengers for the next months.

Making this forecast could be quite beneficial to the company as it would help them take some crucial decisions like - 

- What capacity aircraft should they use?
- When should they fly?
- How many air hostesses and pilots do they need?
- How much food should they stock in their inventory?
